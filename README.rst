This is a character generator designed for the Rolemaster Universal (RMU) role-playing system.  Direct downloads of pyCharGen can be found at https://sourceforge.net/projects/pychargen/files/, which contain stand-alone executables for both Windows and Linux.

pyCharGen is written in python 2.7, and requires the following external packages to be run from source.  Again, no external programs are needed when running from the packaged binaries, only when running from source.
   - pygtk ("sudo apt-get install python-gtk2" in linux or http://ftp.gnome.org/pub/GNOME/binaries/win32/pygtk/2.24/pygtk-all-in-one-2.24.2.win32-py2.7.msi for ubuntu)
   - pyinstaller (http://pyinstaller.org)
   - pywin32 (http://sourceforge.net/projects/pywin32/)
Note: Only pygtk.
               If you wish to use the provided executables or to run from source, it is not needed.
