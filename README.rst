This is a character generator designed for the Rolemaster Universal (RMU) role-playing system.

pyCharGen is written in python 2.7, and requires the following external packages.
   - gtk (sudo apt-get install python-gtk2)
   - pyinstaller (http://pyinstaller.org)
     Note: This is only needed to package the source into a stand-alone executable.
           If you wish to use the provided executables or to run from source, it is not needed.
   - pywin32 (http://sourceforge.net/projects/pywin32/)
     Note: As with pyinstaller, only necessary for packaging into a stand-alone executable.
